The CHANGEPAGE package
=======================

Provides commands to change the page layout in the middle of a document,
and to robustly check for typesetting on odd or even pages.

The changepage package is an extraction of code from the memoir class.
It is a functionally-equivalent replacement for the older chngpage package (which is deprecated but still provided).

VERSION
--------

2026-09-14 v2.0

TAGGING SUPPORT
---------------

If `\DocumentMetadata` is used, the `adjustwidth` and `adjustwidth*` environments are no longer defined as a list. This improves the tagging but also changes the behaviour.


INSTALLATION
---------------

Run `latex` on changepage.ins to produce the files
  changepage.sty and run `lualatex` on changepage.dtx
  to compile the PDF documentation.
